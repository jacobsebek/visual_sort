This program should be capable of drawing rectangles of width
that is directly proportional to the value of an array to be
sorted on that index. The user should be able to choose the
sorting algorithm to be performed by the left and right arrow 
keys, the name of the selected algorithm should be displayed
on the bottom of the display. The user should also have the
choice of scrambling the array, sorting the array and setting
the speed of the algorith. All of the keystrokes should be
visible on the display. During a sort or a scramble, the
rectangle of the current modified index should be filled in
red, whereas all other in white. The display should be
resizable, responsive and eye-appealing in most of the usual 
window sizes.
